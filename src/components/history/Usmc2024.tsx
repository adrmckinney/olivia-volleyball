                A key insight Olivia gained from this experience was the importance of maintaining a
                positive mindset. She recalls one coach comparing negative self-talk to quicksand,
                explaining how it can drag down not only the individual but also the entire team.
                The coach emphasized the importance of resilience and trusting in the abilities of
                every team member. Inspired by this lesson, Olivia is committed to carrying this
                mindset into her upcoming club season, focusing on being a supportive and confident
                teammate both on and off the court.{' '}
