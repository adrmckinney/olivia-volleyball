                Olivia decided to try out for the volleyball team with it being her first ever time
                playing the sport. At first she did not make the team but reached out to the coaches
                to ask what she needs to improve on for next year. The coaches responded with
                feedback as-well-as an offer for a spot on the team. Olivia did not have a lot of
                playing time in her position was as a back row player. In the last few weeks of the
                season coach decided to put Olivia as a setter, and that is when she started to find
                more joy in the sport.
