                Olivia decided to try out for her high school volleyball team as a Freshman despite
                it being her first time playing the sport.

                Initially, she did not make the team, but she took the initiative to reach out to
                the coaches, asking for feedback on what she could improve for the following year.

            &nbsp;
            <p>
                The coaches responded with constructive advice and, to her surprise, offered her a
                spot on the team.

                Though she initially had limited playing time as a back-row player, in the final
                weeks of the season, the coach moved Olivia to the setter position. It was in this
                role that she began to truly enjoy the sport.
