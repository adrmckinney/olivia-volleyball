                Olivia decided to try out for her high school volleyball team as a Freshman despite
                it being her first time playing the sport. Initially, she did not make the team, but
                she took the initiative to reach out to the coaches, asking for feedback on what she
                could improve for the following year. The coaches responded with constructive advice
                and, to her surprise, offered her a spot on the team. Though she initially had
                limited playing time as a back-row player, in the final weeks of the season, the
                coach moved Olivia to the setter position. It was in this role that she began to
                truly enjoy the sport.
