        testimonial:
            'It was an honor coaching Olivia the ’23/’24 club season. Even though it was my first season coaching her, she made tremendous progress under my guidance as a 15 year old. What stood out was her determination to become the best she can be. Her drive to become better is remarkable. The reason I brought her back as a 16 year old to a 17’s team is because of all the hard work she put in during the off season. Her love for the sport is contagious. I know she will excel in the game because she is very coachable and refuses to stop pushing herself.',
